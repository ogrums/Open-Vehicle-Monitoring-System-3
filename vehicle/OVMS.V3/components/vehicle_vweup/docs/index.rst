VW e-Up (T26A)
==============

Vehicle Type: **VWUP.T26**

This vehicle type supports the VW e-UP (2013-, 2020-), Skoda Citigo E IV and the Seat MII electric (2020-).


-----------------
Development notes
-----------------

We prepared the code to use functional units depending on which hardware infrastructure the user uses.

Under this vehicle component we use the original T26A approach, which can write to the Comfort CAN and is able to manage the climate control of the car.

Because T26A does not use the OBD socket and has very limited access to system information a new OBD approach is thought off, but not implemented here.

To compile the code you will need to check out the repository, check out the components 
mongoose, libzip and zlib  and copy the file

sdkconfig.default.hw31

from the OVMS.V3/support folder to the OVMS.V3 folder and rename it to

sdkconfig

----------------------------------------
Pinout OCU T26A - OVMS DB9 adapter cable
----------------------------------------

For the T26A approach we directly tap into the comfort can bus over the OCU cable 

The OCU connector is located under the passenger seat.

Advantage is a faster and easier development.

Disadvantage is that we won't have all vehicle information available
and we won't be able to access all control units.

For confectioning the T26A adapter cable you can use a standard 26 pin ribbon cable (2x13 pins, 2,54mm grid dimension) and a DB9 female D-Sub connector. You will need to grind down the rim of the socket of the ribbon cable.

To make a GSM/GPS adapter cable to connect to the original VW fakra socket you can use a double fakra male connector with two SMA male connectors attached.

-----------------
User notes (T26A)
-----------------

* Disconnect the T26A cable and the fakra cable from the OCU (online communication unit) located beneath the passenger seat.
* Connect the confectioned T26A adapter DB9 cable attached to the OVMS to the VW T26A plug.
* Connect your GMS/GPS fakra adapter to the VW fakra cable.
* Configure OVMS as discribed in the OVMS user manual
* Register and connect OVMS to a server (as guided within the OVMS setup)
* Install the OVMS app on your smartphone or tablet and configure to connect to the server
* Enjoy :-)

----------------------
Climate control (T26A)
----------------------

Climate control works, as long as write access to the comfort can has been enabled in the app or in the OVMS webinterface (VW e-Up ... -> Features).

Once the AC is turned on by the app there will be a delay of about 15 seconds till the AC actually starts in the car. Further 10 seconds all communication from the app to the car is blocked.

The communication from the app to the car is also blocked for 10 seconds after the "AC off" command from the app to the car. There is no delay between the "AC turn off" signal of the app and the actually turning off in the car.

In rare cases climate off does not respond. You then need to start it again (when it is already running) to be able to stop it.

The cabin target temperature can be set from the OVMS webinterface (VW e-Up ... -> Climate control).
