BMW i3 / i3s
=============

Vehicle Type: **BMWI3**

This vehicle type supports the BMW i3 and i3s models. All model years should be supported.

The OVMS support was developed Jan 2021.

It was developed against the author's 2018 120Ah i3s BEV.  I would welcome engagement from
the owner of a REX type to further develop metrics related to the REX engine. Testing by
drivers of LHD models, as well as those with the smaller batteries will also be helpful.

As of this release this vehicle support is read-only and cannot send commands to the car.

WARNINGS
--------

Alarm behaviour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As standard, the i3 will sound the alarm if anything is left connected to the OBD-II
port when the car is locked.

A tool like Bimmercode will allow you to disable this. Alternatively
you will need to disconnect the OVMS unit before locking the car.

A future version may add a command to allow you to disable this alarm directly
from your OVMS shell.

12V Battery drain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The i3 has a small 20Ah AGM 12v battery. Whilst care has been taken to minimize OVMS' power usage,
OVMS could eventually drain this battery if the car is left unplugged and locked.
OVMS will also send an alert if 12V drops under 12V alert threshold. (See 12V Calibration section).

HOWEVER: If you are going to leave the car for a fews days, it is recommended to unplug OVMS.

----------
Car status
----------

The car is accessible over the OBD-II port when it is running (ignition on) and for a short time
(40 seconds or so) after it is turned off or the car is "tweaked" (lock button pushed,
connected-drive command received, etc).

Unfortunately this means that when your car is standing or charging OVMS only has
intermittent access to data from the car.  

By observation, whilst the car is charging it wakes up now and then (seems to be every 30 minutes).
So at those times we can update our SOC etc.

Metrics "v.e.awake" tells you if the car is awake or not.  Metric "xi3.s.age" will tell you how
many minutes have passed since we last received data from the car.

You may also refer to metric xi3.s.pollermode as follows:

==== ================================================
Mode Meaning
==== ================================================
 0   Car is asleep - no OBD-II data traffic
 1   Car OBD-II is awake - we are seeing data traffic
 2   Car is ready to drive or driving
 3   Car is charging

----------------
To be researched
----------------

Can we start/stop charging?

Can we pre-heat?

Can we lock/unlock the car?

Can we disable the OBD-II alarm

Still looking for the trip regen kWh

Can we get the voltage state of each individual cells rather than just the battery min / max / average?
