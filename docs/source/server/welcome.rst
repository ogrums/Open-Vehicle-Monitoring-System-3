The OVMS (Open Vehicle Monitoring System) team is a group of enthusiasts who
are developing a means to remotely communicate with our cars, and are having fun while doing it.

The OVMS module is a low-cost hardware device that you install in your car simply
by installing a SIM card, connecting the module to your carâ€™s Diagnostic port connector,
and positioning a cellular antenna. Once connected, the OVMS module enables remote control
and monitoring of your car.

This guide documents the installation and operation of an OVMS server.

You should, however, start by asking yourself the question 'do I need this?'.
You don't need to run your own OVMS server, as you can just use one of the public
Open Vehicles OVMS servers. The choice is yours.
