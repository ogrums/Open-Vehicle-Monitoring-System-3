Welcome

For some time now I've wanted to offer an HTTP API for OVMS. The existing
car<->server and server<->app protocol is cool, but requires going through
some hoops (perl, whatever) to handle the encryption and protocol level
stuff. An HTTP API would make this much easier to externally script, and
would be great for pulling down logs and other such things.

This document describes this HTTP API.
